  ## :pencil: Description

  OOTD is a good way to keep track of what the user has worn throughout the week. A user can add a post, add a link to the photo, write what they did on that day and describe their outfit and paste a link of their clothing item. The user can also look at other users' post by going to the homepage in order to get some outfit ideas. In case there are spelling errors, or the user wants to add more information, they can edit their entry. If they want to remove it completely, they can remove it.
